<h2>My fit text method</h2>
<p>
  There are many ways to fix text to the width of the parent. The first option from this CSS Tricks article <a href="https://css-tricks.com/fitting-text-to-a-container/">fitting text to a container</a> recommends using viewport units and a magic number to fit text in a container.
  The problem is, finding this magic number. My solution involves measuring the text width at a few font sizes on a hidden HTML5 canvas.
  Those sample measurements are fed into a <a href="https://github.com/RobertMenke/JS-Polynomial-Regression">JS-Polynomial-Regression</a> model which can then predict the font-size for any width container.
  After getting the predicted font-size; it is clamped to min/max sizes, converted to vw viewport units, and applied to the elements' style.
</p>
<p>
  Font size can be predicted with as few as 3 sample measurements which is insanely fast compared to my first approach of measuring text widths while recursively increasing the font-size until they fit.
  It's not exact (especially on resize), but the fluid vw units are close enough. Itâ€™s a trade-off of simplicity vs. accuracy.
  I've not found any JS library that implements this method, so I may build an NPM package out of it to share with the world.

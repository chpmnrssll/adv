- title: "Headline Creation Tool"
  description: "A full stack application built using the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, and Node.js). The main goal was to have a GUI tool for creating/editing headline images based on multiple layers of images and text with HTML5 Canvas. The back-end API was meant to automate server side rendering of the saved headlines with variable text. Most of the front-end is complete and I was working on the API/DB connections when it was cancelled."

- title: "VENoM-Docker"
  description: "A Docker development environment based on Vue, Express, Node, and MongoDB. This was meant to be my original starting point for the Headline Creation Tool app and required a few bug fixes to address issues with the MongoDB/Mongoose connections. After switching to a plain MEVN stack, I gave the original author my fixes as a PR so it would still be useful to someone in the future. The author also has an interesting tutorial/article on medium.com about the project."
